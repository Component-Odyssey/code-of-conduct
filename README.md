# Component Odyssey Code of Conduct
The Code of Conduct for the Component Odyssey Discord Server

## Harassment

Harassment includes

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.
- Making light of/making mocking comments about trigger warnings and content warnings.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (e.g., textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes. This extends to non-consensual screen captures or sharing of personal information.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others.
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.
- Sending unwanted private messages—especially when requested not to.
- Microaggressions, which include consistent and subtly negative messages toward a particular person or their work.

The Component Odyssey team will not act on complaints regarding:

- "Reverse" -isms, including "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", and "cisphobia".
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone", "go away", or "I’m not discussing this with you".
- Communicating in a "tone" you don’t find congenial.
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions.

## Reporting

If you are experiencing harassment, or observe someone else being harassed, please send a direct message to myself or a moderator. You can also send me an email at karoulla.andrico@gmail.com.

All reports will be treated with strict confidentiality, and your identity will not be disclosed without your explicit permission when giving a warning or a ban to someone that has broken the Code of Conduct.

If you have been found to break the Code of Conduct, then depending on the severity of the harassment, you’ll be warned or immediately banned at my (andrico) discretion.

## Sharing Work

I, and I imagine many of the others in this group, would love to see the amazing things you’ve built, both directly as a result of the course, or indirectly using what you’ve learnt. We have the #showcase channel for sharing anything cool that you’ve built, or found on the internet.

If you’re sharing work created by someone else, then please credit the person whose work it is.

Please do not send any spam, this includes irrelevant content, or the same piece of content multiple times.

Please do not send any conta affiliate links. The priority should be to provide value to the community, and not for your personal gain.

## Communicating

Please be encouraging. Everyone’s learning journey is different. The web is a vast platform so if someone doesn’t know about certain APIs, features, or any other information, please point it out in a constructive way. Please do not be condescending.

Please do not share anyone’s personal information without their prior consent. This includes sharing personal information about members to outside of the Discord group.

The harassment rules also apply to usernames and profile pictures. Please ensure that your usernames and profile pictures are appropriate and non-offensive.

Accessibility is also important. Please use clear language and provide content warnings for flashing images or loud sounds in any content that you share.

I recognise that nobody’s perfect, so if you spot anyone breaking these social rules, just give them a friendly reminder, or ping me or one of the moderators.
